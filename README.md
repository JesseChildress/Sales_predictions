  -Make visual representations to better understand the data
  -Make refined visual representations to be able to present my findings from my explorations of the data
  -Use Machine Learning regression models (linear regression, decision trees, bagged trees, and random forests) to create predictions for item sales
  -Recommend the best regression model out of the ones I fit to the data
