# sales-predictions
This is code for a sales prediction for food sold at various stores, using data from 10 different stores compiled in this dataframe:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1syH81TVrbBsdymLT_jl2JIf6IjPXtSQw/view.

In this project, I: 

  -Clean the data
  
  -Explore the data
  
  -Make visual representations to better understand the data
  
  -Make refined visual representations to be able to present my findings from my explorations of the data
  
  -Use Machine Learning regression models (linear regression, decision trees, bagged trees, and random forests) to create predictions for item sales
  
  -Recommend the best regression model out of the ones I fit to the data
  
It can be seen that:

  -Grocery stores have the lowest sales, and Type 1 Supermarkets have the highest
  
  -OUT027, a medium-size Type 3 Supermarket, has the highest sales
  
  -OUT027 has item visilibity in it store closer to the mean than the other stores
  
From the analysis, I recommend:
  
  -Avoiding dominating visibility in the store with a few products
  
  -Avoiding investing in Grocery Stores, because they have the lowest sales
  
  -Doing further analysis on OUT027, a Type 3 Supermarket that significantly outperformed all the other stores in sales
